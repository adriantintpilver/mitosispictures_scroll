                    <img src="shows a longitudinal section of a root tip of Broad Bean (Vicia faba) with cells from the region of cell division, just behind the root cap. (See also Vicia root tip Is2).   This meristematic tissue is the site of intense mitotic activity as the root tip grows down through the soil. Mitosis is the process of nuclear division that produces two genetically identical daughter cells, each with the diploid chromosome number. Between mitotic divisions, a cell is in a stage called interphase. A number of cells in interphase are visible to the right of the image. They are small, with their nuclei occupying a large proportion of each cellâ€™s volume. Inside many nuclei, darker spots are visible, which are the nucleoli. During interphase, the DNA is replicated ready for its partitioning into the two daughter cells.
